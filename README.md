# fact of the Day
Growing list of fact of the days for my discord server.

## Instructions on how to add a fact-

- Go to ```Community posted facts/```
- Create a new file with the "Create new file" button

![Create new file](/images/create_new_file.png)
- Rename the file to your username and end it with / to create a folder

- Rename again to fact_#.txt where the # is what number the fact is starting from 1.

- Type in your new fact of the day. Only post 1 fact per file so that it is easier to search through and keep nots of what ones have been used.

- Once the fact is writen out you can then scroll down to the botom of the page and click the "Propose new file" button

- And finally the last thing you have to do is click the big green "Create pull request" button and let me handle the rest

- Just click the button again cause this part isnt needed.
